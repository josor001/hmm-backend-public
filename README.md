# HMM

This repository contains the backend component of the **Holistic Microservice Management Platform** (HMM) which is a software platform that enables teams applying the microservice architecture style to codify their knowledge so that it is accessible to other teams.  

HMM is a research prototype licensed under MIT and was developed as part of a dissertation project. We invite all interested practitioners and researchers to extend the platform as they wish or to adopt individual parts.

This project is implemented with Kotlin and Maven for build management.

## Build

Run `mvn clean install` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `target/` directory.
Data is stored using a file-based H2 database in the `data/` directory.

## Further Information

For further information please contact the author or read the dissertation (to appear in summer 2024).
